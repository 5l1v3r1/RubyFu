# Meterpreter Scripting

From the official [wiki][1], The Meterpreter is an advanced payload that has been part of Metasploit since 2004. Originally written by Matt "skape" Miller, dozens of contributors have provided additional code, and the payload continues to be frequently updated as part of Metasploit development.

Meterpreter is a payload framework that provides APIs to interact with by writing scripts and plugins that increase its capabilities. You can find meterpreter scripts in `metasploit-framework/scripts/meterpreter` those scripts that you use in post exploitation using **run** (eg. getuid, getsystem, migrate, scraper, etc). Meterpreter source code is located in `metasploit-framework/lib/rex/post/meterpreter`

Actually, you can't imagine the power of Meterpreter until you read its [wishlist and features][2] not just use it.


To get started, let's to get Meterpreter shell on a victim machine to start practicing it inline then we can write some scripts 

Once you get the meterpreter shell type `irb` to be dropped into ruby's irb. Most of required modules will be loaded already. 

Then type `require 'irb/completion'` to support auto-completion for the irb console, just like the follows

```
msf exploit(handler) > run

[*] Started reverse handler on 192.168.0.18:4444 
[*] Starting the payload handler...
[*] Sending stage (957486 bytes) to 192.168.0.18
[*] Meterpreter session 1 opened (192.168.0.18:4444 -> 192.168.0.18:33603) at 2015-11-22 06:33:00 +0300

meterpreter > irb
[*] Starting IRB shell
[*] The 'client' variable holds the meterpreter client

>> require 'irb/completion'
=> true
```
