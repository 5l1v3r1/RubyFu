# Meterpreter Scripting

From the official [wiki][1], The Meterpreter is an advanced payload that has been part of Metasploit since 2004. Originally written by Matt "skape" Miller, dozens of contributors have provided additional code, and the payload continues to be frequently updated as part of Metasploit development.

Actually, you cant imagine the power of Meterpreter until you read its [wishlist and features][2] not just using it.
