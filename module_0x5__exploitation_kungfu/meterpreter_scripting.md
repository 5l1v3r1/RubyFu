# Meterpreter Scripting

From the official [wiki][1], The Meterpreter is an advanced payload that has been part of Metasploit since 2004. Originally written by Matt "skape" Miller, dozens of contributors have provided additional code, and the payload continues to be frequently updated as part of Metasploit development.

Meterpreter is a payload framework that provides APIs to interact with by writing scripts and plugins that increase its capabilities. You can find meterpreter scripts in `metasploit-framework/scripts/meterpreter` those scripts that you use in post exploitation using **run** (eg. getuid, getsystem, migrate, scraper, etc). Meterpreter source code is located in `metasploit-framework/lib/rex/post/meterpreter`

Actually, you can't imagine the power of Meterpreter until you read its [wishlist and features][2] not just use it.
