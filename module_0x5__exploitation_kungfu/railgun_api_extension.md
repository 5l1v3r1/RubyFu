# Railgun API Extension
Quoting from [Railgun presentation in DefCon20](https://www.defcon.org/images/defcon-20/dc-20-presentations/Maloney/DEFCON-20-Maloney-Railgun.pdf), **Railgun** is an extension to the Meterpreter STDAPI, allows arbitrary loading of DLLs. Since Windows API DLLs are always at known paths, we can always load them.

The ultimate benifits of using Railgun is getting the ability of dynamically access to the entire windows API on the system. By calling APIs from user process, we can impersonate user, anything become possible. 

Raingus is used as POST exploitation API so known it well would open a new abilities to the post exploitation phase. 


**Path**
- `metasploit-framework/lib/rex/post/meterpreter/extensions/stdapi/railgun`


As an extension, we'll test it as the same as we were testing previous extensions, buy tripping the meterpreter console to `irb` console. We'll have instantiated object called `client` or `session` as we know previously.

- To list all loaded DLL
```ruby
>> client.railgun.known_dll_names
=> ["kernel32", "ntdll", "user32", "ws2_32", "iphlpapi", "advapi32", "shell32", "netapi32", "crypt32", "wlanapi", "wldap32", "version", "psapi"]
```

- To list all available function and its parameters for specific DLL (say `user32`)
```ruby
client.railgun.user32.functions.each_pair {|n, v| puts "Function name: #{n}, Params: #{v.params}"}
```

Now, let's trying it,

- Popping-up a message box
```ruby
client.railgun.user32.MessageBoxA(0, "Ruby goes evil!", "Rubyfu!", "MB_OK")
```

Results

- Lock Windows Screen
```ruby
>> client.railgun.user32.LockWorkStation()
=> {"GetLastError"=>0, "ErrorMessage"=>"The operation completed successfully.", "return"=>true}
```
