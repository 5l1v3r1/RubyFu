# DNS Spoofing
Continuing our attack through [ARP Spoofing](module_0x4__network_kungfu/arp_spoofing.md), we want to change the victim's DNS request to whateven distination we like.

### Scenario
```
                |Attacker|
                    | AttackerSite
                    Ù§                      AttackerSite
|Victim| ----------/ \----------> |Router| ----------> Internet
          AnySite      AttackerSite
```
> Keep the ARP spoof attack running

The same IPs of ARP spoof attack

| Host        |   IP Address  |
|:-----------:|:-------------:|
| Attacker    | 192.168.0.100 |
| Victim      | 192.168.0.21  |
| Router      | 192.168.0.1   |



Now we cant intercept DNS Query packet comming from victim's machine. Since PacketFu supports filters in capturing (to reduce mount of captured packets) we'll use `udp and port 53 and src` filter, then we'll inspect the captured packet to ensure that it's a query then find the requested domain..........


**DNS lookups Table**

|  Type | Value |               Description               |
|:-----:|:-----:|:---------------------------------------:|
| A     | 1     | IP Address                              |
| NS    | 2     | Name Server                             |
| CNAME | 5     | Alias of a domain name                  |
| PTR   | 12    | Reverse DNS Lookup using the IP Address |
| HINFO | 13    | Host Information                        |
| MX    | 15    | MX Record                               |
| AXFR  | 252   | Request for Zone Transfer               |
| ANY   | 255   | Request for All Records                 |

From wireshark, if we take a deeper look at the DNS query payload in `Domain Name System (query)`, we can see its presentation in hexdecimal.

|:---------------:|
| **Figure 1:** Full Payload content |



Let's to anatomize our payload
```
0000   e7 1d 01 00 00 01 00 00 00 00 00 00 07 74 77 69
0010   74 74 65 72 03 63 6f 6d 00 00 01 00 01
```
* The First 2 bytes is the **Transaction ID**. (Our case: `\xe7\x1d`)
* The Nex 2 bytes is the **Flags**. (Our case: `\x01\x00`)

Farthermore, in `Queries` section
```
0000   07 74 77 69 74 74 65 72 03 63 6f 6d 00 00 01 00
0010   01
```

* The **domain name queries** starts at 13 byte of the payload.
    * The13th byte specifies the length of the domain name before the dot com. (Our canse: `\x07`)
    * The dot in front of the com is epresented by a `\x03`.
    * The end of the domain name string is terminated by a `\x00`.
* The next 2 bytes refers to the **type of the query**. (Our canse: `\x00\x01`)



```ruby
