# DNS Spoofing
Continuing our attack through [ARP Spoofing](module_0x4__network_kungfu/arp_spoofing.md), we want to change the victim's DNS request to whateven distination we like.

### Scenario
```
                |Attacker|
                    | AttackerSite
                    Ù§                      AttackerSite
|Victim| ----------/ \----------> |Router| ----------> Internet
          AnySite      AttackerSite
```
> Keep the ARP spoof attack running

The same IPs of ARP spoof attack

| Host        |   IP Address  |
|:-----------:|:-------------:|
| Attacker    | 192.168.0.100 |
| Victim      | 192.168.0.21  |
| Router      | 192.168.0.1   |



Now we cant intercept DNS Query packet comming from victim's machine. Since PacketFu supports filters in capturing (to reduce mount of captured packets) we'll use `udp and port 53 and src` filter, then we'll inspect the captured packet to ensure that it's a query then find the requested domain..........
