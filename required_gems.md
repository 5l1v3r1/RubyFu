# Required Gems
I'd like to list all gems that will be used in this book. Note that you don't need to install it all unless you need it

## 
Install main required gems in one line.
```
gem install pry
```
To run pry with best appearance
```
pry --simple-prompt
```

> **Note:** Most of our example will be executed on **pry** so please consider it as main part of our environment. Otherwise (when you see `#!/usr/bin/env ruby`) then it means a file script to execute.
