# Chapter 0x2 | Array KungFu

## Pattern

#### Pattern create

Assume the pattern length = 500, You can change it to any value. By default this will create 20280 probabilities max.
```ruby
pattern_create = ('Aa0'..'Zz9').to_a.join.each_char.first(500).join
```
Incase you need longer pattern(ex. 30000) you can do the following
```ruby
pattern_create = ('Aa0'..'Zz9').to_a.join
pattern_create = pattern_create  * (30000 / 20280.to_f).ceil
```

#### Pattern offset

I’ll assume the pattern was equal or less than “20280” and we are looking for “9Ak0” pattern characters. The pattern_create should be initialized from above
```ruby
pattern_offset = pattern_create.enum_for(:scan , '9Ak0').map {Regexp.last_match.begin(0)}
```
Note: This does not consider the little indean format, for that there is extra code should be written. For more info, please take a look on the following [code](https://github.com/KINGSABRI/BufferOverflow-Kit/blob/master/lib/pattern.rb).


#### Generate all hexdecimal values from `\x00` to `\xff`

```ruby
puts (0..255).map {|b| ('\x%X' % b)}
```
> **Notes:**

> - To change value presentiation from `\xea` to `0xea`, change `\x%x` to `0x%x`
> - To Make all letters capital (`\xea` to `\xEA`) , change `\x%x` to `\x%X`

short and unclean
```ruby
256.times.map &:chr
```
